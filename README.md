# Customer_Behavior_Analysis 
🛍️# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
A comprehensive data analytics project that explores customer shopping patterns, spending habits, and purchasing behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI. This project demonstrates a complete data workflow — from raw data to actionable business insights.

# Project Overview 
Understanding customer behavior is key to driving business growth. In this project, I analyzed a customer shopping dataset to uncover trends in spending, product preferences, discount usage, and subscription patterns. The analysis is structured across three powerful tools:

- Python for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering
- SQL for querying and answering specific business questions
- Power BI for building an interactive dashboard to visualize insights

 # Tools & Technologies 
  - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

  - PostgreSQL & SQLAlchemy

  - Power BI

  - Jupyter Notebook
    # Key Analyses & Business Questions Answered
   SQL-based insights:

   - Revenue breakdown by gender and age group

   - Impact of discounts on high-spending customers

   - Top-rated products and most popular items per category

   - Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal) based on purchase history

   - Subscription behavior among repeat buyers
     
 Python-driven transformations:

  - Handled missing values in Review Rating

  - Created new features: age_group and purchase_frequency_days

  - Removed redundant columns like promo_code_used (mirrored discount_applied)
    
 Power BI Dashboard Highlights:
 
   - Total Customers: 3.9K

   - Avg. Purchase Amount: $59.76

   - Avg. Review Rating: 3.75

   - % of customers by subscription status

   - Sales distribution across product categories

   - Revenue contribution by age group

   -  Interactive filters for Gender, Category, and Shipping Type

# Key Findings
After analyzing customer shopping data, several interesting patterns emerged. Clothing is clearly the star category, bringing in the most revenue, with items like Blouses and Jeans being customer favorites. When it comes to who's spending, Middle-aged and Young Adult customers are the biggest contributors to sales.

We also discovered that only 27% of customers are subscribed, but these subscribers tend to spend differently than non-subscribers. Interestingly, customers who use discounts aren't always bargain hunters — many of them still spend above the average amount, showing that discounts can attract quality customers without hurting revenue.

Most products receive solid review ratings around 3.75, and there's a clear group of loyal customers (those with 10+ previous purchases) who keep coming back. Shipping preferences vary, but understanding which types lead to higher purchases can help streamline operations
